# Advent of Code 2022 Archive

Imported from [nbrader/advent-of-code-2022](https://github.com/nbrader/advent-of-code-2022). Each day contains:

- `problem.txt`: original puzzle prompt
- `standard/`: reference Haskell solution and data inputs
- `animated/`: placeholder for an eventual animation-friendly version
