# Animation Batch Files

**Note**: The main animation batch file has moved!

Please use the new batch file located at the project root:

```
run_animations.bat
```

This new batch file:
- Works for all years (2022, 2023, 2024)
- Has better path handling
- Provides a cleaner interface
- Supports all animation features including input selection

The old `run_all_animations.bat` in this directory is kept for backwards compatibility but may be removed in the future.
