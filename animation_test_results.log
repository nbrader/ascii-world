ANIMATION TESTING LOG
Date: 2025-11-15
==================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Total animations found: 67
- 2022: 25 animations (days 01-25)
- 2023: 21 animations (days 01-21)
- 2024: 16 regular animations (days 01-16)
- 2024: 5 curated animations (days 06, 10, 16, 18, 20)

Status: UNABLE TO RUN - Stack not installed
Network access restricted in current environment.
All animations analyzed statically instead.

==================================================
ANIMATION STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
==================================================

All animations follow a consistent pattern:
1. Shebang: #!/usr/bin/env stack
2. Stack script header with dependencies
3. ANSI terminal-based visualization
4. Command-line argument support for input types:
   - "example" (default)
   - "data" (actual puzzle data)
   - "example2", "example3" (additional examples)
5. Load data from CSV files in respective directories

Common dependencies:
- Stack resolver: lts-21.22
- Packages: ascii-world, containers-0.6.7, ansi-terminal-0.11.5
- Additional for some: array, split, safe

==================================================
YEAR 2024 - CURATED ANIMATIONS (5)
==================================================

Curated animations are optimized/enhanced versions of selected days.
They may have different package requirements or special features.

Day 06: test/2024/curated/day06_animated.hs ✓ EXISTS
  Description: "Guard Gallivant" - Shows guard walking grid with step/turn/exit/loop detection
  Packages: containers, ansi-terminal (NO ascii-world)
  Features: Visual path tracking with ANSI colors

Day 10: test/2024/curated/day10_animated.hs ✓ EXISTS
  Packages: containers, ansi-terminal, array
  Additional dependency: array package

Day 16: test/2024/curated/day16_animated.hs ✓ EXISTS
  Packages: containers, ansi-terminal

Day 18: test/2024/curated/day18_animated.hs ✓ EXISTS
  Packages: containers, ansi-terminal
  Note: No regular animation exists for day 18

Day 20: test/2024/curated/day20_animated.hs ✓ EXISTS
  Packages: containers, ansi-terminal
  Note: No regular animation exists for day 20

STATUS: All 5 curated animation files exist and ready to run

NOTE: Days 06, 10, and 16 have BOTH regular and curated versions.
      The batch file run_animations.bat uses curated versions for these days.
      Days 18 and 20 ONLY have curated versions.

==================================================
BATCH INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS
==================================================

Current run_animations.bat Analysis:
-------------------------------------

STRENGTHS:
1. ✓ Clear hierarchical menu structure (Year → Day)
2. ✓ Shows available animation counts per year
3. ✓ Input type selection (example/data/example2)
4. ✓ Intelligent routing to curated animations for specific days
5. ✓ Proper use of delayed expansion and labels
6. ✓ Consistent package management
7. ✓ Clear visual separators and prompts

ISSUES & SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:

1. INCORRECT COUNT for 2024
   Problem: Batch file says "17 available" but there are actually 18 unique days with animations
            (Days 1-16 regular + Days 18, 20 curated-only)
   Fix: Change line 11 from "1. 2024 Animations (17 available)"
                        to "1. 2024 Animations (18 available)"

2. MISSING VALIDATION
   Problem: No validation of day number ranges
   Suggestion: Add checks like:
     if %DAY% GTR 25 (echo Invalid day! & pause & goto year2024)
     if %DAY% LSS 1 (echo Invalid day! & pause & goto year2024)

3. NO EXISTENCE CHECK
   Problem: Batch file doesn't check if the animation file exists before running
   Suggestion: Add before stack command:
     if not exist "%ANIM_PATH%" (
       echo Animation not found: %ANIM_PATH%
       pause
       goto year2024
     )

4. HARDCODED DAY LIMITS
   Problem: Lines 33, 63, 87 hardcode day ranges in comments
            "Enter day number (1-25)" but some years only have 21 animations
   Suggestion: Update prompts to match actual available days:
     - 2024: "Enter day number (1-16, 18, 20) or 0 to go back"
     - 2023: "Enter day number (1-21) or 0 to go back" [CORRECT]
     - 2022: "Enter day number (1-25) or 0 to go back" [CORRECT]

5. UNCLEAR CURATED SELECTION
   Problem: User doesn't know when curated vs regular animation will run
   Suggestion: Add informational message after day selection:
     if "%day_choice%"=="6" echo Using curated animation for Day 06

6. NO ERROR HANDLING
   Problem: If stack command fails, user just sees error and batch continues
   Suggestion: Add error level check:
     stack ... %ANIM_PATH% %INPUT_TYPE%
     if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
       echo Animation failed with error code %ERRORLEVEL%
     )

7. DUPLICATE PACKAGES SPECIFICATION
   Problem: Package list repeated in multiple places
   Suggestion: Define once at top:
     set BASE_PACKAGES=--package containers-0.6.7 --package ansi-terminal-0.11.5

8. NO "RUN ALL" OPTION
   Problem: Can't easily run all animations in sequence
   Suggestion: Add option "4. Run all animations" in main menu

9. NO SPEED/DELAY CONTROL
   Problem: Some animations might run too fast or slow
   Suggestion: Add optional delay parameter that animations could use

10. LIMITED INPUT TYPE FEEDBACK
    Problem: User doesn't know which input files actually exist
    Suggestion: Check file existence and show which inputs are available

CROSS-PLATFORM ISSUES:
----------------------
The .bat file only works on Windows. The repository is cross-platform Haskell.

Suggestions:
1. Create run_animations.sh for Linux/Mac users
2. Create run_animations.ps1 for PowerShell users
3. Or create a Haskell-based launcher that works everywhere

ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
---------------------------
1. Add color coding to menu (if using ANSI in batch)
2. Add timing information (show how long each animation took)
3. Add progress indicator for multi-animation runs
4. Add option to save animation output to file
5. Add "recently run" quick-launch menu

==================================================
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS TO RUN
==================================================

Prerequisites:
1. Haskell Stack installed (lts-21.22 resolver)
2. Required packages:
   - ascii-world (this library)
   - containers-0.6.7
   - ansi-terminal-0.11.5
   - array (for some animations)
   - split (possibly)
   - safe (possibly)

3. Input data files must exist in respective directories:
   - test/YYYY/dayXX/dayXX (example).csv
   - test/YYYY/dayXX/dayXX (data).csv
   - test/YYYY/dayXX/dayXX (example 2).csv (optional)

4. Terminal with ANSI color support
5. UTF-8 encoding support

Platform Compatibility:
- Windows: Use run_animations.bat or run_tests_utf8.bat
- Linux/Mac: Use stack directly with runghc
- All: Animations have shebang for direct execution if stack in PATH

==================================================
ANIMATION INVENTORY SUMMARY
==================================================

Total Animation Files: 67
  2022: 25/25 days (100%)
  2023: 21/25 days (84%)
  2024: 18/25 days (72%) - 16 regular + 2 curated-only

All files verified to exist ✓
All files follow consistent naming ✓
All files have proper stack headers ✓

Days with Multiple Versions:
  2024 Day 06: Regular + Curated
  2024 Day 10: Regular + Curated
  2024 Day 16: Regular + Curated

Curated-Only Days (2024):
  Day 18: Curated only
  Day 20: Curated only

==================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TESTING
==================================================

1. Install Stack if not present:
   - Windows: https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/windows-x86_64-installer.exe
   - Linux: curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
   - Mac: brew install haskell-stack

2. First-time setup:
   stack setup --resolver lts-21.22
   stack build --resolver lts-21.22

3. Test individual animation:
   stack --resolver lts-21.22 runghc \
     --package ascii-world \
     --package containers-0.6.7 \
     --package ansi-terminal-0.11.5 \
     test/2024/day01/animated/day01_animated.hs example

4. Or use direct execution (if stack in PATH):
   cd test/2024/day01/animated
   ./day01_animated.hs example

5. Use the batch file on Windows:
   run_animations.bat

6. Create automation script for comprehensive testing
   (as attempted in this session, but requires Stack)
